# Sample elicitation

This code is the official implementation of our paper "[Sample Elicitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03155)" accepted by AISTATS2021.

## Utilities

ðŸ“‹ (1) Syntheric Experiment: this folder is the Matlab implementation of our porposed mechanism w.r.t. synthetic data (as an example, we adopt the synthetic data drawn from 2-D Gaussian distributions).

ðŸ“‹ (2) MNIST Experiment: this folder is the Python implementation of our porposed mechanism given image data (as an example, we adopt MNIST test dataset).

Note: details of reproducing our experiment results are mentioned in the ``README" file in each folder.
